## Suggested Fonts for CSS

Corporate theme typography (used via CSS, not prompt):
- Already uses system-ui fonts for maximum corporate blandness

---

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Keep it gray** - Corporate means desaturated
2. **Add mundane details** - Motivational posters, dying plants
3. **Office props** - Staplers, coffee cups, sticky notes
4. **Fluorescent lighting** - That flat, soul-crushing glow
5. **Cubicle aesthetic** - Fabric walls, rolling chairs
6. **Passive-aggressive notes** - On fridges, microwaves, etc.
7. **Forced cheerfulness** - Birthday banners, team building
8. **The Business Cat is key** - Ramona in a suit is the hero
9. **Use --s 250** for stylized pixel look
10. **Use --v 7** for game art style

---

## Priority Assets for Corporate Mode

1. **Business Ramona** (idle, walk, run - all directions) - CRITICAL
2. Headers can use existing ones with grayscale filter (CSS handles this)
3. Category sprites are optional (CSS makes existing ones grayscale)
4. Everything else is polish
